# 📝 Imam Lecture Creation Workflow - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This document explains how imams can add lectures after logging in to the Deenly v2 platform. The system provides a complete workflow for authenticated content creation with role-based access control.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization System

### Current Implementation Status

✅ **Database Schema Ready**

- Users table with role-based access (`Admin`, `Imam`, `Member`, `Visitor`)
- Lectures table with proper relations
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured

✅ **Supabase Authentication Setup**

- Client/server authentication utilities configured
- Ready for production use

❌ **Frontend Authentication** (Implemented in this session)

- Login page created: `/[locale]/auth/login`
- Dashboard created: `/[locale]/dashboard`
- Lecture creation form: `/[locale]/dashboard/lectures/new`
- Lecture management: `/[locale]/dashboard/lectures`

## 🚀 How Imams Add Lectures - Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Authentication

1. **Login Process**
   - Navigate to `/auth/login`
   - Enter email and password
   - System verifies credentials via Supabase Auth
   - Checks user role (must be `Imam` or `Admin`)
   - Redirects to dashboard upon successful authentication

### Step 2: Dashboard Access

1. **Dashboard Overview** (`/dashboard`)
   - Displays welcome message with imam's name and mosque
   - Shows quick action cards:
     - ✨ "Add New Lecture" - Create new content
     - 📚 "Manage Lectures" - View existing lectures
     - ⚙️ "Mosque Settings" (Admin only)
   - Recent activity feed

### Step 3: Create New Lecture

1. **New Lecture Form** (`/dashboard/lectures/new`)
   - **Title**: Required field for lecture title
   - **Type**: Dropdown selection:
     - Khutba (Friday sermon)
     - Lecture (General religious talk)
     - Dua (Supplication)
     - Quran (Recitation)
   - **Content**: Large textarea for main content
     - Supports Arabic text (RTL automatic detection)
     - Paragraph formatting supported
     - Unlimited length
   - **Status**: Publication status
     - `Draft`: Only visible to creator
     - `Public`: Visible to all users
   - **Submit Options**:
     - Save as Draft
     - Publish immediately

### Step 4: Content Management

1. **Lecture Management** (`/dashboard/lectures`)
   - View all created lectures
   - Filter by status (Draft/Public/Archived)
   - Quick stats: views, creation date, type
   - Actions per lecture:
     - 👁️ View (if public)
     - ✏️ Edit
     - 🗑️ Delete (with confirmation)

## 🗄️ Database Integration

### RLS Policies

```sql
-- Allows imams/admins to create lectures for their mosque
CREATE POLICY "Mosque members can create lectures" ON lectures
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users
    WHERE users.auth_user_id = auth.uid()
    AND users.mosque_id = lectures.mosque_id
    AND users.role IN ('Admin', 'Imam')
  )
);

-- Allows authors to update their own lectures
CREATE POLICY "Authors can update their lectures" ON lectures
FOR UPDATE USING (
  created_by IN (
    SELECT id FROM users WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

### Lecture Data Structure

```typescript
interface Lecture {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  type: string; // 'Khutba', 'Lecture', 'Dua', 'Quran'
  status: "Draft" | "Public" | "Archived";
  mosque_id: string;
  created_by: string;
  num_views: number;
  title_translations: object; // For future multilingual support
  translation_map: object; // For future AI translation
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

## 🚦 Getting Started - Next Steps

### For Administrators

1. **Create User Accounts**

   ```sql
   -- Insert imam user into users table
   INSERT INTO users (name, email, role, mosque_id, auth_user_id)
   VALUES ('Imam Name', 'imam@mosque.de', 'Imam', 'mosque-uuid', 'auth-user-uuid');
   ```

2. **Enable Authentication**
   - Configure Supabase Auth settings
   - Set up email templates (optional)
   - Configure redirect URLs

### For Development

1. **Test Authentication Flow**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to /auth/login
   # Test with created imam credentials
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Ensure your database has the 4 mosques from FINAL-UPDATE-4-MOSQUES.sql
   -- Create test imam users for each mosque
   ```
