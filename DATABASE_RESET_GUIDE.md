# üîÑ Supabase Database Reset Guide

This guide will help you reset your Supabase database to its original empty state, removing all tables and data that were created during the debugging session.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING

**This will permanently delete ALL data in your database!**  
Only proceed if you want to completely reset your database to a clean state.

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Select your project: `hhjfykwyzqimqcsvlady`

### Step 2: Open SQL Editor

1. In the left sidebar, click on **"SQL Editor"**
2. Click **"New query"** to create a new SQL script

### Step 3: Reset Database Tables

Copy and paste the following commands **one by one** into the SQL Editor and run each individually:

```sql
-- Remove lectures table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.lectures CASCADE;
```

```sql
-- Remove mosques table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.mosques CASCADE;
```

```sql
-- Remove any other tables that might exist
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.khutbas CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.imams CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.prayer_times CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.events CASCADE;
```

```sql
-- Remove custom types
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS public.lecture_status CASCADE;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS public.mosque_service CASCADE;
```

```sql
-- Remove custom functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.incr_lecture_viewer(uuid) CASCADE;
```

### Step 4: Verify Database is Clean

Run this verification query to confirm all tables are removed:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
```

**Expected Result:** This should return no rows (empty result) or only system tables.

### Step 5: Confirm Reset Complete

Your database is now reset to its original state when you should see:

- ‚úÖ No custom tables in the `public` schema
- ‚úÖ No custom functions
- ‚úÖ No custom types
- ‚úÖ Clean slate for future development

## üõ°Ô∏è What's Preserved

- Your Supabase project remains active
- API keys and project URL stay the same
- Authentication system (if you had set it up)
- Supabase system tables and functions
- Project settings and configurations

## üéØ Next Steps

After resetting, your database will be completely clean and ready for:

- Fresh schema design
- New table creation
- Clean development start
- Whatever direction you want to take the project

## üîß Alternative: Use the SQL File

Instead of copying commands manually, you can:

1. Open the `reset-database.sql` file in this project
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Run the entire script at once

**Remember:** This action cannot be undone. Make sure this is what you want before proceeding!
